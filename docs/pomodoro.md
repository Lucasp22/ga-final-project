# Pomodoro Log

I am trying work on my project in Pomodoro sessions.
To prevent myself from burning out.
Unless noted differently, each session below is 25 minutes, with at least 5 minute break before next session.

Install stripe gem, create basic HTML views (without styling) to confirm functionality I created using tests.
If I find any problems while making views, I will go back and write for it first.

## Sun 26 Aug 2.50 pm
Continue writing views

## Sund 26 Aug 3:25 pm
Still writing basic views. Using bootstrap styles for laying out, but will improve later.
Next task is writing booking form with Stripe component

## Mon 27 Aug 8.15 am 
Started styling All tours page, realised that my navbar is not visible and i'll have to set up a background image for All Tour and probably other pages so that navbar scrollis consistent.

## Mon 27 Aug, 8.50 am
Decided on making list of tours as a Bootstrap table. Need to add image row to Tour table to display in the tours# index list. Background is Russian pattern.


## Mon 27 Aug, 9.41 am
Added img to Tours, now they display in the tour#index, made substring to display description partly. Need to make a button for booking/view more details.
